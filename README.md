# Quick-Chat

Quick-Chat is a feature-rich Android chat application built using Kotlin, Firebase, and various modern Android development libraries. The app incorporates Firebase Phone Authentication, Firestore for real-time data storage, Firebase Storage for media content, and employs the MVVM architecture pattern. It also utilizes Jetpack Navigation Components, Hilt for dependency injection, Kotlin Coroutines, Kotlin Flows, RecyclerView with DiffUtil for efficient list updates, the new Splash Screen API and much more.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Utilizes Firebase Phone Authentication for secure user sign-in.

- **Firestore Database:** Stores and retrieves real-time data using Firestore, enabling seamless chat and user interactions.

- **Firebase Storage:** Manages media content, such as images and videos, with Firebase Storage.

- **Jetpack Navigation Components:** Implements a single-activity architecture with various fragments for smooth navigation.

- **Hilt for Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Hilt for efficient dependency injection across the app.

- **Kotlin Coroutines and Flows:** Implements asynchronous programming using Kotlin Coroutines and Kotlin Flows.

- **MVVM Architecture:** Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern for clean and modular code.

- **RecyclerView with DiffUtil:** Optimizes list updates using RecyclerView and DiffUtil for efficient rendering of chat, user, and recent chat lists.

# Technologies Used
- **Kotlin:** Primary programming language for Android app development.
- **Android Studio:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- **Navigation component:** One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.
- **Firebase Phone Authentication:** Managing Accounts/Logging in and Registrations.
- **Firebase Firestore:** Database for the system.
- **Firebase Storage:** To store  images and user profile pictures.
- **MVVM clean architecture:** Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- **Coroutines and kotlin flows:** For asynchronous programming.
- **View Binding:** Instead of inflating views manually, view binding will take care of that.
- **Glide:** Cache images and load them in imageView.
